Baseline Schedule
=================

A simple, flexible web-based organizer for structuring your daily schedule. It doesn't attempt to track unique events and appointments, and is not intended to replace your existing calendar (GCal, iCal, etc.) Rather, it provides a **baseline schedule** from which you can deviate, as needed, but then return to throughout the day to manage large, otherwise unstructured blocks of time.

Currently in early development. At this point, merely a web-based [Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) timer.

Usage
-----

To use the timer, head to <http://exegetic.net/baseline-schedule/>.

The default is 25 minutes. To specify a different duration, append `?duration=[NUMBER_OF_MINUTES]`, like so: <http://exegetic.net/baseline-schedule/?duration=60>.
